My website is hosted on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service), with a domain from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), secured by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), a frontend designed with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Loconotion](https://github.com/leoncvlt/loconotion) for parsing pages and a [GitHub](https://github.com/Zerobrofan) Actions pipeline to automate builds.
